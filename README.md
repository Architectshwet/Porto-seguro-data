# Porto-Seguro-Safe-Driver-Prediction


 Used ggplot2 and cowplot libraries to construct bar plot, stacked bar chart, histogram, mosaic plot, corrplot to understand the relationship between the features.

 Imputing missing values, changing features to appropriate data types and ROSE package to balance the target variable using over and under sampling.

 Designed xgboost (with tuning the hyperparameters using caret) and randomforest model from scratch and compared the result with confusion matrix and roc curve and extracted importance variable for each.
